# QOSF-Screening-Task
This project is for the screening task of QOSF. I complete the task 2. This task require us to implement a 2-qubits parameterized quantum circuit that return |01> and |10> with equal probability. The parameters of this circuit is optimized with a gradient descent algorithms.

I complete this task with qiskit package. The optimization part is done with Pennylane, a quantum machine learning package.
